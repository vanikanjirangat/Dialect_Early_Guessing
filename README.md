# Early guessing of dialects by incremental analysis

This is the implementation of our paper in EMNLP 2022 Findings: Early Guessing for Dialect Identification

The paper discuss about the experiments, which are primarily data-centric approaches for achieving the problem statement:
 *Detection of dialects before the full input utterance is given.*
We used model calibration approaches with BERT-based modelas and found generalizable criteria. (For more details, check the paper).
